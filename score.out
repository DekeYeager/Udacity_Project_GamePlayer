
This script evaluates the performance of the custom_score evaluation
function against a baseline agent using alpha-beta search and iterative
deepening (ID) called `AB_Improved`. The three `AB_Custom` agents use
ID and alpha-beta search with the custom_score functions defined in
game_agent.py.
